### Description

The `CrowdSec_Bouncer` extension for Magento 2 has been designed to protect Magento 2 hosted websites from all kinds of attacks.

### Prerequisites

To be able to use this blocker, the first step is to install [CrowdSec v1](https://doc.crowdsec.net/Crowdsec/v1/getting_started/installation/).

Please note that first and foremost CrowdSec must be installed on a server that is accessible via the Magento 2 site. 
Remember: 
> CrowdSec detects, bouncers deter.


### Usage

#### Features

When a user is suspected to be malevolent, CrowdSec will either send him/her a Captcha to resolve or simply a page notifying that access is denied. 

Please note that it is possible to customize all the colors of these pages in a few clicks so that they integrate best with your design. 

On the other hand, all texts are also fully customizable. This will allow you, for example, to present translated pages in your users’ language.


#### Configurations

This module comes with configurations that you will find under `Stores → Configurations → Security → CrowdSec Bouncer` admin section.

These configuartions are divided in three main parts : 

##### 1) General Settings
